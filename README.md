# BeanDocker

BeanDocker gives you the ability to create additional docker containers using the current image and with the environment variables 
that Beanstalk uses to start each new container.
  



## Installation

Install:

    $ gem install bean_docker

## Usage

To launch a new container on an Elastic Beanstalk docker instance:

    $ sudo bean_docker

## Development

Still experimental.  You have to run the executable with sudo or relax permissions on a key file.  While I've gotten the code to work, I've not gotten it to run as part of the gem yet.
