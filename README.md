# BeanDocker

BeanDocker gives you the ability to create additional docker containers using the current image and with the environment variables 
that Beanstalk uses to start each new container.
  



## Installation

Install:

    $ gem install bean_docker

## Usage

To launch a new container on an Elastic Beanstalk docker instance:

    $ sudo bean_docker

## Development

Still experimental.  You have to relax permissions on a file to get this to work.
