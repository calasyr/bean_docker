# BeanDocker

BeanDocker gives you the ability to create additional docker containers using the current image and with the environment variables 
that Beanstalk uses to start each new container.
  



## Installation

Install:

    $ gem install bean_docker

## Usage

To launch a new container on an Elastic Beanstalk docker instance:

    $ sudo bean_docker

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
